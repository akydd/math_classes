\textbf{Introduction}

$G$ a locally compact group, $H$ a closed subgroup of $G$.  We define and study
natural analogs of the Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes algebras for $G/H$, and show
that when $H$ is compact, $A(G/H)$ can be used to study the nature of $G/H$ in a manner
similar to the group case.

\textbf{Defining $A(G/H)$ and $B(G/H)$}

\sc{Notation}\\
\begin{small}
Let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$.  $q : G \rightarrow G/H$ denotes the canonical quotient map.
$\tilde{x}$ denotes the left coset $xH$.  We have an isomorphism between
$C(G/H)$ and $C(G:H)= \{f\in C(G/H):f(xh) = f(x)\;\forall x\in G,\;h\in H\}$
via the map $\tilde{f} \mapsto f$, where $f = \tilde{f}\circ q$.
We denote the equivalence class of all continuous unitary
representations of $G$ by $\Sigma_G$.  For $\pi \in \Sigma_G$, we let $A_\pi$ denote the closed linear
span of the coefficient functions of $\pi$, and we denote the weak-* closure of $A_\pi$ by $B_\pi$.
For $\rho$, the left regular representation of $G$ on $L_2 (G)$, $A_\rho$ is usually denoted $A(G)$.
\end{small}

\begin{defn}
$$B(G:H) = \{u\in B(G):u(xh) = u(x)\;\forall\;x\in G,\;h \in H\},$$
$$A(G:H) = \{u\in B(G:H): q(\text{supp}\;u)\;\text{compact in}\;G/H\}^{-\|\cdot\|_{B(G)}}.$$
\end{defn}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
%3.1
\begin{prop}
\begin{list}{}{\itemsep -4pt}
\item[(i)] $B(G:H)$,$A(G:H)$ are closed subalgebras of $B(G)$.  Moreover, $A(G:H)$ is a closed ideal in 
$B(G:H)$.
\item[(ii)] $B(G:H)$ is unital.
\item[(iii)] $A(G:H)\cap A(G) \neq \{0\}$ iff $H$ is compact.
\item[(iv)] $A(G:H) = B(G:H)$ iff $G/H$ is compact.
\end{list}
\end{prop}

We know that $A(G:H)$ is isometrically isomorphic to $A(G/H)$ when $H$ is compact
and normal.  We can do better:

%3.2
\begin{prop}
Let $H$ be a closed normal subgroup of $G$.  Then $B(G:H)$ and $A(G:H)$ are isometrically
isomorphic to $B(G/H)$ and $A(G/H)$ respectively.
\end{prop}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
%3.3
\begin{theorem}
Let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$.  Then there exists a projection
$P:B(G) \rightarrow B(G:H)$ with $\|P\| \leq 1$.
\end{theorem}

In general, $P$ does not map $A(G)$ onto $A(G:H)$.  However, for compact subgroup $K$,
we have
$$
P(f)(x) = P_K (f)(x) := \int_K f(xk) dk.
$$
Thus we have the following corollary:

%3.4
\begin{cor}\label{3.4}
Let $K$ be a compact subgroup of $G$.  Then $P_K$ is a continuous projection of $B(G)$ onto $B(G:K)$.
The restriction of $P_K$ to $A(G)$ is a projection of $A(G)$ onto $A(G:K)$.
\end{cor}
\end{slide}

%% remarks, pg 178,179
The analog of the Fourier Algebra for the coset space $G/H$ is usally considered to be
the space $A_{\pi_H}$, where $\pi_H$ is the quasi-regular representation of $G$ determined
by $H$.  This definition has two major problems.

{\bf Problem I.} $A_{\pi_H}$ is in general not an algebra.

For example, when $K$ is a compact subgroup, $A_{\pi_H}$ is an algebra iff $A_{\pi_H} = A_{\pi_{K_1}}$, 
where $K_1 = \cap_{x\in G} xKx^{-1}$.  Since $K_1$ is normal, $A_{\pi_{K_1}} = A(G/K_1)$
(Arsac, 1976).

We can say more:

%3.7
\begin{prop}
Let $K$ be a compact subgroup of $G$.  Then $A(G:K) = A_\pi$ for some $\pi \in \Sigma_G$ iff $K$
is normal.
\end{prop}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
{\bf Problem II.} It is possible to have two distinct closed subgroups $H_1$, $H_2$, and yet
$A_{\pi_{H_1}} = A_{\pi_{H_2}}$, even when these subgroups are compact (Arsac, 1976).

%3.5
\begin{prop}\label{3.5}
Let $K_1$, $K_2$ be compact subgroups of $G$.  Then $A(G:K_1) = A(G:K_2)$ iff $K_1 = K_2$.
If $G$ is a [SIN]-group and $H_1$, $H_2$ are closed subgroups of $G$ with $H_1 \neq H_2$, then
$A(G:H_1) \neq A(G:H_2)$.
\end{prop}

%3.6
\begin{cor}
Let $K_1$, $K_2$ be compact subgroups of $G$.  Then $B(G:K_1) = B(G:K_2)$ iff $K_1 = K_2$.  If $G$
is a [SIN]-group, then $B(G:H_1) = B(G:H_2)$ for $H_1$, $H_2$ closed subgroups of $G$, iff $H_1 = H_2$.
\end{cor}
{\it Proof:}
in either case, $f_1$ as constructed above is in $B(G:K_2)$\;$[B(G:H_2)]$,
but not in $B(G:K_1)$\;$[B(G:H_1)].\;\Box$
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
% remarks, pg 179
In light of the above problems for $A_{\pi_H}$, $A(G:H)$ and $B(G:H)$ are more useful analogs for $G/H$ of the
Fourier and  Fourier-Stieltjes algebras.

\begin{defn}
We define $A(G/H)$, the Fourier algebra of the coset space $G/H$, to be the subalgebra
of $C(G/H)$ identified with $A(G:H)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
We define $B(G/H)$, the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of the coset space $G/H$, to be
the subalgebra of $C(G/H)$ identified with $B(G:H)$.
%Moreover, we give $B(G/H)$ the obvious norm.
\end{defn}

When $H$ is a compact subgroup, $A(G/H)$ and $B(G/H)$ have many of the same properties
of $A(G)$, $B(G)$.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\begin{defn}
$AP(G/H)$ is the set of all $f\in C(G/H)$ such that the set $\{ _x f: x\in G\}$ is
relatively compact in the norm topology of $C(G/H)$ (Skantharajah, 1985).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
$WAP(G/H)$ is the set of all $f\in C(G/H)$ such that the set $\{ _x f: x\in G\}$ is
relatively compact in the weak topology of $C(G/H)$ (Skantharajah, 1985).
\end{defn}

%3.8
\begin{prop}
Let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$.  Then,
\begin{list}{}{\topsep -4pt \itemsep -4pt}
\item[(i)] $B(G/H)\subseteq WAP(G/H)$, and $B(G/H)\cap AP(G/H)$ is the space identified with
$B(G:H)\cap AP(G)$.
\item[(ii)] $B(G/H)\cap AP(G/H)$ is a complemented subalgebra of $B(G/H)$ with the Radon-Nikodym
property.
\end{list}
\end{prop}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
%remarks, pg 180
Recall that $A(G)$ is sup-norm dense in $C_0 (G)$.  For a compact subgroup $K$,
$A(G/K)$ is also sup-norm dense in $C_0 (G/K)$.  However, when $H$ is not compact,
there may exist $f\in C_0 (G/H)$ such that $f\not\in WAP(G/H)$ (Chou).  Thus $A(G/H)$ may
not separate the points of $G/H$.  The proof of Proposition~\ref{3.5} gives the following
result.
%3.9
\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a [SIN]-group with a closed subgroup $H$.  Then $A(G/H)$ separates points in $G/H$.
\end{theorem}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
This next proposition extends a result of Herz (1973).

%3.10
\begin{prop}
Let $K$ be a compact subgroup of $G$.  Let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$ such that $K\subseteq H$.
Then every $\tilde{u} \in A(H/K)$ extends to a function $\tilde{u}_1 \in A(G/K)$ with
$\|\tilde{u}\|_{A(H/K)} = \|\tilde{u}_1\|_{A(G/K)}$.
\end{prop}
%{\it Proof:}
%Let $u\in A(H:K)$ be the function identified wtih $\tilde{u}$.  By Herz's result,
%$u$ extends to some $v\in A(G)$ of equal norm.  Let $u_1 = P_K (v)$.
%Since $\|P_K \| \leq 1$, $\tilde{u}_1$ is the desired extension.$\Box$

We can extend a $u \in B(H)$ to some $v\in B(G)$ when $G$ is a [SIN]-group
or if $H$ is normal (Cowling, Rodway, 1979).

%3.11
\begin{prop}
Let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$.  Assume that either $G$ is a [SIN]-group or that $H$ is normal.
Let $H_1$ be another closed subgroup containing $H$.  Then every $u\in B(H_1/H)$ extends to a 
$v\in B(G/H)$ with the same norm.
\end{prop}
\end{slide}

%We assume we have a measure $\mu$ on $G/H$ such that for every $f\in L_1 (G)$,

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a semisimple commutative Banach algebra.  $\Delta (\mathcal{A})$ denotes
the maximal ideal space of $\mathcal{A}$.  Given any closed set $A$ of $\Delta (\mathcal{A})$,
we define the following ideals:\\
$I(A) = \{u\in \mathcal{A}: u(x) = 0\;\forall\;x\in A\}$\\
$j(A) = \{u\in I(A): \text{supp}\;u\;\text{is compact} \}$\\
$J(A)=$ the norm closure of $j(A)$ in $I(A)$.\\ 
$A$ is said to be of spectral sythesis if $I(A) = J(A)$.
$A$ is said to be of weak spectral synthesis if for each $u\in I(A)$, there exists a positive integer $n$
such that $u^n \in J(A)$.  We say that (weak) spectral sythesis fails if there exists a closed subset $A$
of $\Delta(\mathcal{A})$ that is not a set of (weak) spectral synthesis.
%\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}
\begin{defn}
A multiplier of $\mathcal{A}$ is a linear operator $T$ on $\mathcal{A}$ for which $T(uv) = uT(v)$.
We denote the set of all such mps by $\mathcal{M}(A)$, a Banach space with the operator norm.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a Banach $\mathcal{A}$-bimodule.  A derivation of $\mathcal{A}$ on $\mathcal{X}$
is a linear map $D: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ such that $D(uv) = uD(v) + D(u)v$ for every
$u$, $v \in\mathcal{A}$.

%4.1
\begin{theorem}
$A(G/K)$ is a regular commutative Banach algebra with $\Delta A(G/K) = G/K$.
\end{theorem}
{\it Proof outline:}
Let $\tilde{x}_0 \in G/K$.  $\delta_{\tilde{x}_0} (\tilde{u}) = \tilde{u}(\tilde{x}_0)$ is
continuous multiplicative linear functional on $A(G/K)$.\\
Suppose $\tilde{\Phi} \in \Delta(A(G/K))$.  We can identify $\tilde{\Phi}$ with $\Phi \in A(G:K)^*$.
$A(G:K)$ is complemented in $A(G)$ by Corollary~\ref{3.4}.  Thus there exists $\Gamma \in VN(G)$
with $P^*_K (\Phi) = \Gamma$ and $\Gamma |_{A(G:K)} = \Phi$.  $\Phi \neq 0$, so $\Gamma \neq 0$.
It can be shown that supp$\Gamma = x_0 K$ for some $x_0 \in G$.  $x_0 K$ is a set of spectral sythesis
for $A(G)$ (Forrest, 1992), therefor $\Gamma$ is the weak-* norm limit of $\Psi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i L_{x_i}$,
where $x_i \in x_0 K$.  But $L_{x_i} |_{A(G:H)} = \Phi = \delta_{\tilde{x}_0}$.
It can be shown that the map $\tilde{x}_0 \mapsto \delta_{\tilde{x}_0}$ is a homeomorphism
of $G/K$ onto $\Delta(A(G/K))$.$\Box$

\item[(ii)] $G/K$ is an amenable coset space
\item[(iii)] $A(G/K)$ has a bounded approximate identity consisting of functions with compact support in $G/K$

\begin{cor}
Let $G$ be an amenable locally compact group with a compact subgroup $K$.  Then
${\mathcal M}(A(G/K)) = B(G/K)$ and the usual norms agree.
\end{cor}

\begin{slide}
%4.3'
\begin{prop}
Let $K$ be a compact subgroup of $G$.  Let $\tilde{E} \subset G/K$ be a set for which (weak)
spectral synthesis fails in $A(G/K)$.  Then (weak) spectral synthesis fails for $q^{-1}(\tilde{E})$
in $A(G/K)$.  In particular, if (weak) spectral synthesis fails for $A(G/K)$, then (weak)
spectral synthesis fails for $A(G)$.
\end{prop}

%4.4
\begin{cor}
Let $G$ be a locally compact group for whiuch $A(G)$ admits (weak) spectral synthesis.
Then $G$ is totally disconnected.
\end{cor}

%4.5
\begin{cor}
Let $G$ be a locally compact group with a compact subgroup $K$.  Then each singleton $\{x\}
\subset G/K$ is a set of spectral synthesis for $A(G/K)$.  Furthermore, if $G$ is amenable,
then every finite subset of $G/K$ is a set of spectral synthesis.
\end{cor}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
%4.6
\begin{prop}
Let $G$ be amenable with compact subgroup $K$.  Let $\{x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\}$ be a finite
subset of $G/K$.  Then $I = I_{G/K} \{x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\}$ has a bounded approximate
identity $\{u_\alpha\}$ in $A(G/K) \cap C_c (G/K)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{theorem}
Let $K$ be a compact subgroup of $G$.  The following are equivalent:
\begin{list}{}{\topsep -4pt \itemsep -4pt}
\item[(i)] $G$ is amenable
\item[(ii)] If $I$ is a cofinite ideal of $A(G/K)$, then $I=I(\{x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\})$ where $n=\text{codim}\;(I)$
\item[(iii)] Every cofinite ideal in $A(G/K)$ has a bounded approximate identity
\item[(iv)] Each homomorphism of $A(G/K)$ with finite dimensional range is continuous

%% Section 5
%5.1
\textbf{Weak amenability of $A(G)$}

\begin{defn}
A commutative Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is weakly amenable if every continuous derivation
from $\mathcal{A}$ into a commutative Banach $\mathcal{A}$-bimodule is identically zero.
\end{defn}

$A(G)$ is weakly amenable if $G$ is discrete (Forrest, 1988).  If $G$ is the rotation group
on $\Re ^3$, then $A(G)$ is not weakly amenable (Johnson, 1994).  Very little is know about the class of groups
$G$ for which $A(G)$ is amenable.  We show that this class contains all totally disconnected
groups.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
%5.1
\begin{theorem}\label{5.1}
Let $H$ be an open subgroup of $G$.  Then $A(G/H)$ is weakly amenable.
\end{theorem}
{\it Proof:}  Let $D: A(G/H) \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ be a continuous derivation into a 
commutative Banach $A(G/H)$-bimodule.  Let $\tilde{u}$ be an idempotent in $A(G/H)$.
Then $D(\tilde{u}) = D(\tilde{u}^n) = nD(\tilde{u})$ for $n\geq 2$.  Thus $D(\tilde{u}) = 0$.
$H$ is open, so the linear span of the idempotents is dense in $A(G/H)$.  Hence $D$ is
identically zero.$\Box$

%5.2
\begin{lemma}\label{5.2}
Let $G$ be totally disconnected.  Let $u\in A(G)$ and $\epsilon > 0$.  Then there
exists an open compact subgroup $K$ and a $v\in A(G:K)$ such that $\|u-v\|_{A(G)} < \epsilon$.
\end{lemma}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
%5.3
\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be disconnected.  Then $A(G)$ is weakly amenable.
\end{theorem}
{\it Proof:}  Let $D: A(G) \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ be a continuous derivation into a 
commutative Banach $A(G)$-bimodule.  Let $K$ be a compact open subgroup of $G$.  The
restriction of $D$ to $A(G:K)$ determines a derivation of $A(G/K)$.  By Theorem~\ref{5.1},
$D$ is zero on each $A(G:K)$.  By Lemma~\ref{5.2} each $u\in A(G)$ can be approximated
within $\epsilon$ by some $v\in A(G:K)$ for some open compact subgroup $K$.  Thus $D=0$.
$\Box$

%5.4
\begin{prop}
Let $G_1$, $G_2$ be such that $A(G_i)$ is weakly amenable for $i=1,2$.  Then
$A(G_1 \times G_2)$ is also weakly amenable.

Let $G=G_1 \times G_2$ where $G_1$ is abelian and $G_2$ is totally disconnected.  Then
$A(G)$ is weakly amenable.
